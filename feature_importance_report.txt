=========================================================

This report outlines which employee factors drive the AI's decision-making process, ranked by influence.

## Top 10 Most Influential Factors (The 'Big Drivers')
These features have the massive impact on whether an employee is flagged as High Risk.

1. **MonthlyIncome** (Impact Score: 0.0812)
   - *What it means*: Financial stability is often the #1 retainer. Lower income relative to role increases risk.

2. **Age** (Impact Score: 0.0709)
   - *What it means*: Career stage proxy. Younger employees explore; older employees settle. High predictive power.

3. **TotalWorkingYears** (Impact Score: 0.0622)
   - *What it means*: Experience level. Senior staff are generally more stable than freshers.

4. **OverTime** (Impact Score: 0.0619)
   - *What it means*: Burnout indicator. Employees working overtime are significantly more likely to quit.

5. **DailyRate** (Impact Score: 0.0549)
   - *What it means*: Daily pay rate (similar to HourlyRate/MonthlyIncome).

6. **YearsAtCompany** (Impact Score: 0.0523)
   - *What it means*: Loyalty/Stability metric. The 'Lifer' effect—longer tenure drastically reduces risk.
